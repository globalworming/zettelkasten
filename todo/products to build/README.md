# Hands free flash-card learning
Problem: I'd like to learn with custom flash-cards while traveling, riding my bike or driving my car. So I need some way to create flash-cards that are read to me and I need to signal "yeah I know that" with the limited controls I got, Play, Pause, Next Track, Previous Track.

MMP: Create plain text files and use text-to-speech? Or records audio files with questions and answers? ⏯️ starts/stops, ⏭️ signals "i know the answer, give me the next card". Plain text could be just a single big text file you host somewhere (e.g. github), enter the url, get into your car. Cards just cycle through.
